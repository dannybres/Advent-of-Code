# Advent-of-Code

My advent of code solution in MATLAB.

I am particularly proud of [2022 day 19](https://github.com/dannybres/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/2022/Day%2019/day19puzzle2.m), where I implemented Dynamic programming for the first time by myself. I even got a [mention](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zur64s/introducing_your_aoc_2022_mistiltoe_elfucators/) by the mods on the AoC subreddit for it.

There is a distinct lack of comments, purely a time constaint. Contact me if you want more details on some implementation. @Dannybres@mastodon.social is a good place to get hold of me.
